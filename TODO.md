# TODOs

**bold** = need to discuss!

- [ ] check if reading measures are calculated correctly
- [ ] **all column headers should be the same in all data files (decide for good names)**
- [ ] **all labels are encoded the same (e.g. expert is now sometimes E and sometimes 0 or 1)**
    - [ ] expert / non-expert
    - [ ] gender
    - [ ] 
- [ ] **encoding of nan / missing values (sometimes nan, sometimes . or something)**
- [ ] check data types in code book and rename, so far created automatically from csv
- [ ] codebook
    - [ ] remove duplicate column names, e.g. word features or text tags and reference to the table where they are defined
    - [ ] decide for capitalization? sometimes all caps, sometimes camel case, sometimes weird...
    - [ ] look at todos in codebook --> for some data files there are todos
- [ ] delimiters! all should be the same, it is a mix between 4 spaces and tab (comma?) --> make all tabs
- [ ] add table of contents to codebook
- [ ] debug all scripts one more time! (they look nicer but might still produce garbage)
- [ ] spell check
