# TODOs

**bold** = need to discuss!

- [ ] check if reading measures are calculated correctly and debug all scripts one more time! (they look nicer but might still produce wrong output)
- [ ] write bsh script to run all scripts in correct order
- [ ] add syllables to abbr e.g. dna-fragment we're doing it phonetically
- [ ] go over codebook tables and check entries and possibly adapt manually (only in the very end)
- [ ] Und es fehlt auch noch Informationen zu den comprehension questions und wie sie kodiert sind. 
- [ ] for some readers we do not have accuracy values (?) --> add to the codebook missing values column which ones are missing (the raw nan count is not really informative)
- [ ] fix mismatching pos tags (see stuff to check)
- [ ] layout der button box irgendwo darstellen
